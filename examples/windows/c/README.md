# C example

### Embed an image inside code

This example embed the image *simon-maage-unsplash.bmp* inside the files:

- [smbmp.h][6] (header)
- smbmp.c (data)

The command line to create the files:

    bin2src.exe -l c -h -f smbmp simon-maage-unsplash.bmp

The output binary data at `smbmp.c` are accessed within [`example.c`][5] through the 
variable 'smbmp_data', used to create a [device independent bitmap][4] (DIB), which is 
displayed inside a windows client area.

---

The test [`example.c`][5] could be compiled (without any changes) with:

- Visual Studio Community 2019 (MSVC - Version 19.26.28806 - x64)<sup>*</sup> 
- MinGW64 gcc version 10.1.0 (Rev3, Built by MSYS2 project)<sup>*</sup> 


For MSVC, just create a C++ project, import all source files (.c and .h) and run the 
project.

For MinGW64, run the following command to compile and create the executable:

    gcc -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -O3 -mwindows -m64 -o example.exe example.c smbmp.c


<sub>*these are the versions used during the tests</sub>
