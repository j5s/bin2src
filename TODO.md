# TODO List

### Important

- [x] document and format all the code
- [ ] revise the (very much likely) mistakes with English language
- [ ] organize and optimize entire project
- [ ] make tests on Linux and other plataforms
 
### Not so important

- [ ] implement new languages
- [ ] review the format of all text on repo
 
### Maybe...

- [ ] implement a 'plugin interface' like for new languages
